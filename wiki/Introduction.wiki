= Introduction =

nxPascal is a free game engine that tries to remain lightweight and portable. It is compilable under latest Lazarus on possibly all operating systems, and at least Delphi 7. So far this covers:
 * 2D and 3D OpenGL graphics.
 * Demos on most features, for both Lazarus and Delphi.
 * 2D, 3D and much of gaming supporting math.
 * Particle engine.
 * Pathfinding with own rough but fast algorithm.
 * Network class supporting TCP and UDP.
 * Optional sound wrappers for OpenAL and BASS.
 * Class for handling and rendering a user interface with buttons, listboxes etc.

Basically nxPascal is modular, consistencies are separated in different units. You might choose to just want to use part of the features presented here, if you wish to use another graphics engine or something else. nxGL supports custom window creation, so you can do all that different way, but still being able to use even graphics features of this engine.
